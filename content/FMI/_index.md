## Current issues on capital theory and populism

This graduate seminar is divided in two sections. The **first** one discusses the history of capital theory with particular emphasis on the problem of the period of production. The seminar emphasizes recent applications of finance to the field of capital theory. The topic then explores potential areas of research that connect capital theory with other active fields.

The **second** section looks at the literature studying the recent rise of the left-leaning populism in Latin America. The seminar looks at the difficult task of defining *populism* and contributions from recent work. The seminar concludes with a discussion of areas of research on the issue of 21st century populism.

**Macro with Python** is a set of introductory examples that apply [Python](https://www.python.org/) to typical topics covered in an Intermediate (or advanced) macroeconomics course. The discussion assumes an intro/basic knowledge of Python and same familiarity with intermediate macroeconomic models.

The discussions in this project do not provide a full explanation of macroeconomic models nor intends to show coding **best practices**. The intention of the macro examples is to get started with **how** to use Python in macroeconomics. [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) offers more advanced an detailed documentation.

The macro examples below are written in [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook and rendered with Jupyter's [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). Juyter notebooks are divided in cells, where each cell can be text or code. Since the purpose of this examples is pedagogical, each cell is written as a stand-alone piece of code (no need to execute the codes in previous cells).

The **GitHub** repository of this project is located [here](https://github.com/ncachanosky/Macroeconomics-with-Python).


> **Macro with Python** is an ongoing project. More examples will be added as they become available.


## Macro with Python: Notebooks

All notebooks make use of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

For an example on symbolic mathematics and LaTeX format, see **The Solow Model** (section 1). 

For examples of how to find the roots ([SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)) of a system of equations, see **The Labor Market** (section 3) and **The AD-AS Model** (sections 5 and 6). 

For a shooting algorithm, see **A Simple Ramsey Model** (section 5).

### Where to get Python?

Probably the most user-friendly way to get Python is through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/), an environement that allows to easily download and update Python packages and extensions.

[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) also comes with [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) and other applications.

In addition to its applicatoins, [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) also includes instructional videos and documents.

### Where to write Python code?

You can use a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook. But, it is useful to have an "IDE." Anaconda also comes with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) for Python as well as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you are familiar with R, Anaconda also comes with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/).

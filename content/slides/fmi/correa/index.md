<!-- SLIDE 1: INTRODUCTION -->
### Introduction

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* 21st-century populism in Latin America literature
  * What do we know?
    * Rafael Correa's presidency (2007 - 2017) is one of the iconic left-leaning populist leaders in the region
    * He seized significant political power
    * Empirical work estimates significant economic costs produced by these populist regimes... <span class="blue">except for Ecuador</span>
  * Dollarization is a monetary constitution
    * Ecuador is the only dollarized country in the sample
    * Can dollarization constrain (to some degree) a populist regime?
</p></div>

<!-- SLIDE 2: INTRODUCTION -->
### Introduction

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Why did Ecuador dollarized its economy?
  * Serious financial and economic crisis in the late 1990s
  * No foreseeable alternatives (for instance a currency board)
* Who dollarized?
  * Private sector first
  * Government followed
</p></div>

<!-- SLIDE 3: WHAT IS DOLLARIZATION -->
### What is dollarization

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* A country adopts a foreign currency as its legal tender
* Central ceases its operations (no domestic monetary policy)
* Dollarization works as a monetary constitution
  * Not possible to monetize deficit
  * Not possible to run a domestic monetary policy
  * The central bank cannot operate as lender of last resort
  * Ecuador's situation is "similar" to that of a US state with respect to the Federal Reserve
  * Dollarization is not a monetary rule, it is the adoption of a foreign monetary institution
  * Dollarization is very costly/difficult to reverse
</p></div>

<!-- SLIDE 6: CORREA VERSUS DOLLARIZATION -->
### Ecuador versus other populist regimes

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Two examples of how dollarization can constrain a populist regime
  * Through a stricter budget constraint
  * Digital currency vs the US dollar
</p></div>

---
<!-- SLIDE 7: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->
### Dollarization as a stricter budget constraint

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Let
  * Deficit: $G - T$
  * Government debt: $D$
  * Monetization: $M$
  * Other forms of wealth extraction: $X$
    * Expropriations
    * Nationalizations
    * Confiscations

<!-- SLIDE 8: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->
### Dollarization as a stricter budget constraint

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
| Type of government                       | Deficit's budget constraint       |
|:-----------------------------------------|:---------------------------------:|
|Developed economy with strong institutions| $G = T + \Delta B + \Delta M$     |
|Populist regime with domestic currency    | $G = T + \Delta B + \Delta M + X$ |
|Populist regime in a dollarized economy   | $G = T + \Delta B + X$            |
</p></div>

<!-- SLIDE 9: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->
### Dollarization as a stricter budget constraint

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Financing the deficit
  * For the political leader, the different sources to finance spending are not perfect-substitutes
  * In terms of electoral votes and public support
    * $T \neq \Delta B \neq \Delta M \neq X$
    * Therefore, if $\Delta M$ is not possible, we should expect the behavior of the political leader to be different
</p></div>

---
<!-- SLIDE 10: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->
### Dollarization as a stricter budget constraint

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>

<!-- SLIDE 11: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->
### Dollarization as a stricter budget constraint

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Going around the fiscal constraint

    * Take new debt from China (to be paid back in oil)
</p></div>

<!-- SLIDE 12: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->
### Dollarization as a stricter budget constraint

* Populist turns on populist: Conviction or necessity?
  * In 2015 Correa's popularity starts to decline (so does the growth of the economy)
  * Oil prices start to fall

<!-- SLIDE 12: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->
### Dollarization as a stricter budget constraint

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Populist turns on populist: Conviction or necessity? (cont...)
  * As long as the economy is growing, there are new resources to distribute among interest groups
    * Political coalition
    * Labor unions
    * Legislators and judiciary
    * Police and military
  * When the economy stagnates, the "printing press" is not an option to "buy" political loyalty
    * Interest groups must fight to maintain a shrinking pool of resources
</p></div>

<!-- SLIDE 13: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->

<!-- SLIDE 14: DOLALRIZATION AS A STRICTED BUDGET CONSTRAINT -->

<!-- SLIDE 15: DIGITAL CURRENCY -->
### Digital currency

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Correa: Dollarization is a "monetary suicide"
* 2014: Digital Currency (DE)
  * Issued and stored at the central bank
  * Managed through a phone app (offered only by a state-owned company)
* Expectation vs reality
  * Expected: 500.000 accounts
  * Accounts opened: 410.000
  * Active accounts: 205.000
</p></div>

---
<!-- SLIDE 16: DIGITAL CURRENCY -->
### Digital currency

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* What where de DEs?
  * Claims to US dollars
  * To work similar as a commercial bank fractional reserve account 
</p></div>

---
<!-- SLIDE 17: DIGITAL CURRENCY -->
### Digital currency

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* DE: De-dollarization or fiscal resource
  * De-dollarization
    * Unlikely to succeed in the short-run
  * Fiscal resource
    * The more DE circulates
    * The more of an interest-free loan the government gets
        * EMBI+ climbed from 510bp in 2014 to 1000bp next year
</p></div>  

---
<!-- SLIDE 18: DIGITAL CURRENCY -->
### Digital currency

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* DE success depends on trust on the government
  * Correa is the opposite of trust
  * Default in the recent past, clearly for political reasons
  * Distrust seems to have been rational: The government mandated commercial banks to re-patriate foreign deposits and lend central bank reserves to the treasury
</p></div>  

---
<!-- SLIDE 19: NEXT STEPS -->
### Digital currency

<div class="text"><p data-markdown>
* Next steps
  * More complete background on how dollarization took place
  * Similar or different economic variables than other populisms in the region
  * More background on DE predecessor and reactions by private banks
</p></div>
